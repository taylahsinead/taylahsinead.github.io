          <h1>How does what we eat effect our brain?</h1>
          <br>
          Our two brain hemispheres play inherently different roles when it comes to our state of mind: the right hemisphere is predominantly active during mindsets of creativity, intuition, and imagination, while the left side fires up during tasks of logic, decision making, and analytical thinking. As an artist, it’s crucial to understand that these mental states are inherently different. As we do our work, we are either in a decision-making mindset, or in a mindset of creation and intuition. And while it’s hard to switch to the much desired creative mindset, there are effective ways to help us get there.
          <br></br>
          Our bodies and minds are interconnected. When our gut and organs are under stress, we will likely feel tired, less focused, and irritable. The best way to keep our bodies healthy is through the foods we eat.
          <br></br>
          The largest filter, barrier, and converter between the outside world and our delicate internal environment is our liver. And even though it’s a powerhouse in cleaning the blood, protecting the heart, helping the digestive system, and converting nutrients to exactly the mix we need to survive and thrive, too often our lifestyle choices create a toxic and sluggish liver. This can translate to the mind in the form of toxic thoughts, anxiety, cravings, or fatigue—leaving no room for the creative process to unfold.
          <br></br>
          The brain feeds on glucose, the simple sugar molecule contained in fruits and vegetables. A lack of this “good” glucose will signal your adrenals to start pouring out adrenaline, which in turn will cue your liver to release its glucose reserves in order to prevent your brain from exhaustion. This flood of adrenaline is corrosive for your whole system and will put you in a stress response—consistently activating the sympathetic “fight or flight” nervous system.
          <br></br>
          But there’s a catch: even when we eat the right kind of glucose, but surround it by high levels of fat (think: potatoes with lots of butter, berries with cream, asparagus with hollandaise sauce, banana milkshake, caprese salad), the fat will prevent the glucose from entering our cells. This again starves the brain, and causes the adrenals to pour out adrenaline in an attempt to provide the much-needed glucose to our brains as we try to perform mental labor.
           <br></br>
          This means: increase the amount of good natural glucose from fruits and vegetables in your diet, to keep your brain cool and prepare it for steady, creative performance. Load up on potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, yams, leafy greens, spinach, kale, dates, bananas, mangoes, figs, berries, apricots, and apples. Sprinkle some herbs over your food, and include raw organic local honey in your dressings. Try to cut down on fats and proteins, and observe how that affects your energy levels and general feeling of wellbeing.
